Meta's Scale AI deal has clients like Google halting projects, contractors scrambling, and one investor bailing out. Google, OpenAI, and xAI halted some Scale AI projects following Meta's investment announcement, leaving contractors scrambling. Tech execs are joining the Army — no grueling boot camp required. Tech leaders from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI have joined the Army Reserve, bypassing traditional training to chase transformation. Sam Altman says his own kids will 'never be smarter than AI'.
